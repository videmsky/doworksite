                <p>Do specializes in helping enterprise customers modernize their software delivery through digital transformation services. Our mission is to empower organizations to adopt a non-radical shift-left methodology that enables them to ship quality software more efficiently, securely, and at a higher cadence.</p>
<p>Do works closely with teams to identify their unique needs and goals relevant to their current maturity with software delivery. We then develop customized solutions that address their specific challenges and opportunities. We believe that a one-size-fits-all approach simply doesn&rsquo;t work when it comes to digital transformation, which is why we take a personalized approach to every engagement.</p>
<p>Do believes that software delivery is a journey, not a destination. Our approach is based on expertise and hands-on implementation guided by best practices learned in the field. Methodologies we are experts in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GitOps: As a single source of truth, we rely on Git repositories to broker current and desired state for applications, infrastructure, and microservices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Progressive Delivery: We use Progressive Delivery techniques to gradually roll out changes to applications in production. Rollouts are ideally driven by telemetry thresholds and historical application performance baselines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuous Deployment: We use Continuous Deployment practices to automate the deployment of code changes to target environments ideally without manual intervention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observability: We use telemetry data to monitor and troubleshoot applications across environments. Eg. Metrics, Logs, &amp; Traces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything As Code: Infrastructure as Code, Configuration as Code, Security as Code, Policy as Code, Network as Code. A declarative approach to the state of your assets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do can help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assess your current software delivery process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop a roadmap for modernization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement the necessary tools and technologies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Train your team on the new processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support you through the transition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We believe that software delivery is a critical part of your business. We can help you modernize how you ship software and improve your business outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
